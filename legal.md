# Carolynn Levy And Panel (Jon Levy， Jason Kwon) -  Startup Legal Mechanics

Geoff Ralston: As always on for Startup school, we're going to have two lectures a day and  this is the second lecture, the second lecture of the week.

It's a 10 week  program with just about 20 lectures, give or take. One thing that we neglected to  be clear on is that when you log into your group, if you have this  up at the top, then there is a moderator assigned to your group.

And if  you do not, you do not. Okay.

Again, if you have questions or problems you  can email startupschool@ycombinator.com. Hopefully, most of you don't need to do that because we do  tend to get a lot of email.

There are many of you, but if you  have problems, do let us know.

I would like to introduce my colleague Carolyn Levy  to my right here who's going to talk about startup mechanics.

And then with John  Levy and Jason Kwan, they'll answer some questions about getting your startup started, legal issues.  I will point out that these three folks are probably the finest legal minds in  the startup world.

And I do not exaggerate, they may hate me saying it, but  these folks have seen more, they've worked with more startups in more situations than you  could believe.

And some of those situations you wouldn't believe, so they know everything.

And  so I do hope you listen carefully and I do hope ... Look, I know  you gave everyone homework to watch videos from from 2014 and 2017 on startup mechanics.  I urge you all to watch those videos if you haven't already as an adjunct  to what Carolyn and John and Jason are about to say because you will find  them useful as you build your company. So Carolyn,
Carolynn Levy: Thank you. Jeff, totally exaggerated. But we have seen a lot of stuff. So like  Jeff just mentioned, back in 2014, Kirstie and I did a startup school lecture on  legal and accounting mechanics, and we were hoping that most of you would have time  to watch that before you came here today.

I'm going to blaze through a recap  of that and just a touch on the key takeaways from that lecture. But I  am going to skip the part about investors and fundraising because Kirstie's actually going to  do an entirely separate lecture on that stuff later on in the program. Next, I'm  going to go through some common mistakes and problems that we see founders make.

And  finally, Jason and John are going to come up here.

I want to thank all  of you who sent an email questions to us beforehand because we're going to go  through some of those on some of your legal mechanics questions that you guys already  submitted. Okay. So the first thing you have to do when you're starting a startup  is actually form your separate legal entity; this is your company.

And the act of  incorporating is just filing a document called a certificate of incorporation, which is really short  and simple for startups.

And you go and you file it with the Department of  corporations in whatever state you choose to incorporate in. Now, we strongly recommend choosing Delaware  because the process in that state is really, really easy, and the service is really  fast and efficient.

And that's the primary reason we suggest, but also as a lot  of you probably know most public companies are Delaware companies, so that saves you a  little time if you're going to go public. Some investors actually will require that year  in Delaware before they'll fund you, so that's another good reason to be in Delaware.  Okay. So this has been mentioned a couple times already. We also strongly recommend that  you use an online platform specifically geared to startups to incorporate.

And there's a lot  of these platforms, some are good, some are not so good. Clerky and Stripe Atlas  have already been mentioned and those are the two that we think are great; they're  YC companies. We have extensive experience with Clerky, and I was really happy to hear  that Darby Wong, one of the founders of Clerky is going to do an AMA  because he's great. One of the reasons why we think clerky and Stripe Atlas are  so great is because they don't stop after formation, they also have post incorporation documents.  And some of the not so good platforms stop after formation and they don't do  post incorporation. One of the things that doesn't happen if you don't do post incorporation  is founders don't buy their stock.

And when we were commuting down here today, Jason  reminded me of a story, a really big company and a really big law firm  and they didn't ...

The founders never bought their stock and this wasn't discovered until  the series B financing. So if you think this sounds weird, like of course, founders  need to buy socks, but this is a mistake that actually happens. Okay.

Another step  in the incorporation process is forming a board of directors.

And for early startups, the  members of the board are usually the founders.

If you're a solo founder, you can  have a board of one.

If you are two founders, you can have a board  of two.

There's a misconception that board of directors have to have an odd number  of directors, but that is not necessary.

And then you need to appoint corporate officers.  You need to have a president and or a CEO; you can have both if  you want.

And in Delaware you're required to have a corporate secretary.

And another part  of the process is adopting corporate bylaws for startups; bylaws can be extremely generic.

And  finally, this isn't technically part of the incorporation process, but I encourage you to open  a corporate bank account as soon as possible. Most startups won't have very much cash  to put in that bank account, but it's great to get into the habit of  treating the corporation as a separate entity as early as possible.

And it's critical to  form good habits around the way you treat your company's money. Okay, so post incorporation.  So now we're going to go back to what I just said about issuing founder  stock. You all know that corporations are owned by stockholders and you and your co  founders are going to be the first stockholders. Okay.

If you are a founder team  of two or more, you have to think about how you're going to allocate that  stock. Our belief about the best way to allocate stock among founders is to think  about the challenge of execution.

And that's another way of saying the following. Do not  place too much importance on the founder that had the idea for the business because  all of the hard work is in front of the team and all of the  value is going to be created in the future.

If you are all going to  be working hard going forward, which you all are, we think the equity split should  be more or less equal among you.

If you and your co-founders are having a  really hard time coming to a consensus about stock allocation, there may be underlying trust  or commitment issues with the team. So you want to pay close attention to that.  Okay. Founders need to purchase their shares from the company and you buy them using  a stock purchase agreement, you actually have to pay for them. But fortunately, the stock  of a brand new company is very cheap.

The way most founders stock purchase agreements  work is that you give a very, very small amount of cash and then you  contribute to the company any intellectual property that you've created. So that's the total purchase  price for your founder's shares. Founder's shares should be subject to vesting.

And this ties  back to the point I just made about all the work being ahead of you.  Vesting means that you don't get full ownership of your stock until a certain period  of time has passed. During the vesting period rather, you can vote all of your  shares. But if you quit your company before the full period of time has passed,  the company will automatically repurchase all of your unvested shares. When shares are subject to  vesting, they're called restricted stock. So your founder stock purchase agreement will be actually a  restricted stock purchase agreement.

And as I'm sure most of you know, the standard or  typical vesting period is about four years. So I'm not going to get into cap  tables in this lecture because Kirstie is going to explain them in detail in her  lecture about fundraising mechanics. But the basic idea is that every company absolutely needs to  keep a cap table. You need to keep a record of every single share of  stock that your company issues.

And we used to have to do these on these  complicated excel spreadsheets, but fortunately there are now multiple online platforms that will keep track  of stock ownership effortlessly, and we'll make sure that those resources are included on one  of these, on the forum. Okay. Because founders tend to identify so closely with their  startup, it's easy to forget that they actually need to be employees of their company.  So we'll look at that.

It's pretty self evident that most founders can't pay themselves  in the early days of their startup because practically if there's no money, you can't  have payroll. But if there is enough money, it's a really good idea for founders  to pay themselves minimum wage. Strictly speaking, it's against the law not to pay yourselves,  although obviously this isn't a thing that gets enforced. Okay. So employment, whether of founders  or others, does not require an employment agreement. Employment Agreements are not actually appropriate for  startups because employment is at will by default.

And the basics of hiring and firing  are governed by law anyway.

In facts, employment agreements can sometimes complicate things because courts  may interpret certain of the language in an employment agreement as changing that default at  will status to a four cause status, which makes it a lot harder to terminate  people. So an employee agreement is only necessary if you're hiring an employee who's going  to have something special, like a severance package, and we really don't see those in  startups. But what is really, really important is that all the founders and in the  future, everyone who works for your company has signed a CIIA or a PIIA.

And  I'm sure a lot of you have heard of these; it's a confidential or proprietary  information, invention assignment agreement.

The CIIA protects the company's confidential information and trade secrets and  ensures that all the intellectual property that is created is owned by the company. So  you want everyone in the company signed up to one of these. Very early stage  startups, usually cannot afford to have employees, but the solution is not to convince people  to work for your company for free.

It's one thing for founders to work for  free, but it's significantly riskier for non founders creating work product and other intellectual property  to work for no compensation. So unfortunately, all of you all have to do all  the work until you can afford to hire. Oh, so I'm going to wrap up  this summary and digress from legal mechanics to make a few common sense points.

And  my belief, my personal belief is that ignoring these points can cause you to waste  a lot of time fixing problems later.

These are really common mistakes. So ideally, you  will have opened a corporate bank account as part of or right after incorporating the  company and hopefully you have a little bit of money in it. So you should  use that for all of your company expenses.

If the company bank account has no  money in it and you are paying for all the business expenses with your own  personal savings, the company can reimburse you later when it eventually has money, but you  absolutely need to keep all the receipts and you need to document everything carefully. Corporations  have to pay taxes.

If your startup is a Delaware Corporation, there is an annual  tax you have to pay to that state, but if you calculate it correctly, the  tax owed is really minor for startups. Corporations also have to pay ...

They also  have to file a corporate tax return with the IRS. Obviously when your company is  just getting started, you're not going to actually owe the IRS any taxes, but you  still have to file the return.

And if your startup does have employees, even if  it's just the founders getting minimum wage, you need to pay payroll taxes.

And the  best way to do this is to get set up with an online payroll service  of which there are many. Well, this is a personal favorite of mine, so you  need to find a good place to store the company's legal documents, like the certificate  of incorporation, the bylaws, the CIIAs, the founder stock restricted agreements, founder stock purchase agreements.  For example, a shared Dropbox folder is a good idea. Do not store them in  a co-founders email because you do not want one person to control the access to  these very important documents.

Also, make sure that the legal documents that you are carefully  collecting and storing are actually the signed and dated versions, and triple check to make  sure that every blank signed by every party that needs to sign it. Later when  your company is fundraising and investors are doing due diligence on your company, it just  looks really amateur when you serve up a bunch of formation documents and there's a  bunch of blanks in them.

All right, so that's the summary of that. Oh, sorry,  one more thing.

I just wanted to mention what is acting like a real company,  and my opinion is that acting, if you treat your startup like a board of  directors, a governed, taxpaying founder employee, confidential information holding entity, that that's the way to  act like a real company.

And this is also the only way you're going to  get protection from personal liability, which is the whole point of forming a separate legal  entity anyway. Okay. Now we're going to move on to common mistakes and problems. Okay.  I don't know when to form a corporation.

This isn't actually a problem or mistake,  I just wanted to talk about it here.

And it turns out that a lot  of you emailed us this question. So the right timing on when to pull the  trigger on incorporating is going to be different for every startup. But in general, we  believe in doing it sooner rather than later.

And so my top four reasons about  why you want to do this would be number one, because forming a corporation protects  you and your co-founders from personal liability for your company's actions. Number two, the corporation  is the correct repository for all of the intellectual property that you and your co-founders  are creating. Otherwise, you're all just working on a project, the separate pieces of which  are owned by individuals.

And to me, that's a Hackathon, not a corporation. Number three,  you can't raise ... You all know this, you can't raise real money for your  startup without forming a corporation first because your mom might give you some money for  your startup, but no professional investors is going to wire money to your personal bank  account.

And you need to have a corporation in order to have payroll.

And you  can't enter into contracts or with vendors or consultants or potential customers personally.

And if  you try to do these things as an individual, it's super messy.

I formed an  LLC instead of a corporation because I got advice that LLCs are better for taxes.  So for our purposes, this is usually a mistake because even though LLCs are better  for optimizing taxes, the vast majority of angels and VC firms will not invest in  an LLC. So if you plan to fundraise from people other than a small group  of your friends and family, your startup needs to be a corporation.

The question that  several of you asked in the emails is whether there are other reasons besides fundraising  considerations to form a corporation instead of an LLC. So in other words, if you're  not planning to fundraise for a long time after starting your company, does it make  sense to start out as an LLC and then switch to a corporation later? In  my opinion, the answer is no because I don't believe the tax benefits of an  LLC are compelling enough to outweigh the inconvenience of converting your LLC into a corporation  later.

And for those of you who watched the 2014 startup school lecture, Kirstie and  I told an anecdote about a company that was an LLC and they had to  convert into a Delaware Corp and it was a $400,000 legal nightmare.

It's obviously an  outlier, but we do see this a lot at YC. We see a lot of  LLC to corporate conversions and it's just kind of a headache you don't need. Okay.  I'm thinking about hiring a lawyer to incorporate my company. So this is usually not  a mistake if your startup is really complicated for some reason, or if you've already  formed a non US entity and you now want to come to United States and  raise money.

In these cases, you probably do need to get a lawyer. But I'm  sure all of you know, lawyers are very expensive, so save money and use one  of the good online platforms that we just talked about for incorporation.

Also, realize that  lawyers who are free, like family members doing you a favor, may not be actually  as good as the online platforms because they don't specialize in corporate transactional work. So  your aunt Sally, who does personal injury, may mean well, Clerky and Stripe Atlas will  do a much better job.

I'm starting a startup, but I still have a full  time job.

This is actually already come up today. Common problem for founders because it's  a big decision to ditch the security of a salary.

I think some of the  other speakers in this course, we'll talk about sort of the psychology of taking that  plunge. But if you've decided to work on your startup in your spare time, the  primary legal consideration is just keeping everything separate. So in California, for example, if you're  working on your startup on your own time, with your own resources, your current employers  should have no claim on your new business idea. So use a different computer, don't  work on it during business hours, but keep in mind that different states and even  different countries have very different rules about this particular issue.

And there are things like  noncompete agreements with your employer that may come into play. So if you're going to  do this, you really should do a little bit of research first or get legal  help. Our founding team has been working on this idea for years, so we don't  need vesting on our founder shares.

This is a broken record. We hear this all  the time.

This is a big mistake.

If you don't have vesting, you are setting  your company up for future problems. No investor wants to put money into a company  with founders who may decide the next day that they're burned out, so they take  their shares and they leave. But the more common scenario is that one member of  a founding team decides that he or she is burned out, and so leaves the  company with a giant ownership stake.

The remaining founders have to do all the work,  but someone who's not doing any work has the same ownership.

It is painful to  fix this problem because the price of the company stock may have increased in the  interim and it becomes really expensive for the remaining founders to allocate the share ownership  fairly. How many of you are single founders? I'm just curious. Quite a few of  you. Okay. So, I'm a single founder and I don't need vesting. You may be  thinking.

I think this is also a mistake. Single founders obviously don't have the same  problems that founder teams do, but no vesting is still unattractive to investors for the  same reasons.

Also, you will eventually hire employees and probably grant them stock options and  those stock options will have vesting and it just is a lot better when you  lead by example.

All right.

Another personal favorite.

I signed a legal document but I  was too busy to read it, so I have no idea what it is.

This  happens a lot.

This is a big mistake. We see founders do this all the  time and I mean we sympathize, right? The legal mechanics of your startup are the  really boring parts of the process. You can get away with not reading every word  of your bylaws for example, but you need to understand every provision in your founder  stock purchase agreement. You actually don't want to have anything happen with your company stock  that you don't know every word of.

And this is actually a bigger problem.

This  isn't such a huge problem with formation documents, it's a big problem with fundraising documents.  I can't tell you how many founders have told me they won't read a five  page safe. So you want to get into the habit now of reading all of  your company documents; it's daunting, it's legally, it's whatever. Read it any way, understand it.  It's a great habit to get into.

And then you'll know if it isn't signed.  Okay. My friend offered to work for my startup for free, so I'm going to  pay her with shares. Generally, this is a mistake because people who work for your  company need to be paid money. Obviously compensation packages can include an equity component, but  paying with only stock is not a good idea.

The exception is if you're a  friend can be hired by your company as a consultant or independent contractor; those are  the same thing.

And it's okay for consultants to be paid for services with just  stock, but you have to first get comfortable that your friend is properly classified as  an independent contractor.

And the rules in California about this just changed and got stricter.  Also, you'll want to make sure you paper this relationship with a good consulting agreement  because you really want to make sure that the company owns all of the consultants  work product. You don't want to wing it. Okay.

This is a big one. My  co-founder and I don't want to work together anymore. So this is sometimes a small  problem and this is sometimes a fatal problem. Startups die sometimes because of this, and  it happens unfortunately a lot and it can be overwhelmingly acrimonious.

It's kind of like  watching people get a divorce. So the reason to pay careful attention to the points  have already mentioned like paying yourselves, having vesting on your founder's shares, having a CIIA  that clearly demonstrates that the company owns all the IP that's created. Doing these things  can significantly decrease the legal drama around breakups.

I don't know what decreases the emotional  drama, but that decreases the legal drama. My company has some employees and I promised  to issue them stock.

This isn't a problem as long as you take action on  it sooner rather than later.

And the appropriate action to take is to adopt a  stock incentive plan and to grant stock to these early employees.

A stock plan is  something you probably know, it's like a 15 to 20 page document.

It references a  specific number of shares of your company's common stock that are allocated to the plan.  The company can issue restricted stock or stock options pursuant to the plan, but what  you need to know about stock options is that if you grant stock options, you  have to get something called a [inaudible] evaluation.

And most startups don't want to do  this until after they've had a fundraising event. So you can issue restricted stock to  employees under this plan and they will also have vesting.

And they come with a  whole host of tax insecurities rules, which is why the plan needs to be 20  plus pages long. But the reason to not wait too long to do this is  because the longer you wait, the more expensive your stock will get.

And so you  want to grant ... You want to give your employees cheap stock, or as cheap  as you can because expensive stock is not very incentivizing.

I got a cease and  desist letter.

Another company says, my company is infringing on its trademark.

This is a  problem an early stage startup really doesn't need, but we actually see it happen fairly  often. Founders get very attached to names and once this happens, it's really tough to  let go. But your company is probably too young to have created much value in  the name you picked and the expense and distraction of getting into a trademark dispute  with a more established, better funded company can be substantial. So your best course of  action is let it go. Let the name go. Pick a new name and get  back to work. Related to this, a few of you emailed the question about whether  or not it's worth it to register your company's name and get the official trademark.  Generally we consider a trademark registration to be something that can wait.

It's a nice  to have, not a need to have in the early days of your startup.

All  right. Finally, I picked an awesome name for my company, but I have to pay  10K to get the domains.

This happens a lot. So again, don't fall in love  with the name, that may cause you to make bad decisions no matter how great  that name is.

It is a bad decision to waste time getting into a lawsuit  with a company that claims you stole his trademark, and it is usually also a  bad decision to spend a ton of money on a domain. So do your research  on names, like research, don't just research the PTO, research it, and then do whatever  is cheapest and most efficient and move on. Okay, that's it. So now we're going  to have John and Jason come up and we ... Okay, so what we did  is we took ... You guys emailed us a bunch of questions and we pulled  some out, we edited them a little bit for brevity, but we mostly kept them  sort of unfiltered in original style. So, we're going to go through a bunch of  those now.
Jon Levy: Quick announcement.

There's a red mustang outside with the license plate, MEOW GIK, and a  white land rover with a Nevada license plate. We have to move those.

They're in  the way.
Carolynn Levy: M-E-O-W-G-I-K, red Mustang.

Anybody need to go move their car? White Land Rover? No one's  getting up to move their car.

I'm worried. You guys both have mics? Okay. Jason,  I'm going to ask you the first question when you're ready.
Jason Kwon: Go ahead.
Carolynn Levy: Okay. When does the 30 Day IRS clock for filing an 83(b) election start? And  you might want to start by describing what an 83(b) election form is in case  somebody here does know.
Jason Kwon: Yeah. So an 83(b) election is a tax election. So when you buy stock, if  you don't make an election, what happens is you're taxed on the stock as it  vest. So each vesting period, the amount of stock that that's whatever the value of  the stock is at that time, you incur an income tax for that. But in  83(b) election allows you to be taxed on the difference between the value of the  stock and the price that you pay for the stock on the day that you  actually buy the stock. So it's actually by default in most cases, the best thing  to do when you are a startup founder is to actually make the election so  that because you're going to be paying a very nominal price for your founder stock.  And so there's gonna be no income tax there because you're going to be ...  if you make the election because you're gonna be paying the same amount. So you'll  pay like a dollar for your stock and then basically say that the stock is  worth a dollar and then you make the 83(b) election and then there are no  more taxes that are going to accrue on your vesting as the stock grows and  value. So if you don't do that, which does happen from time to time, you  can be faced with a very large tax liability if your company ends up becoming  very, very valuable as your stock vests.

And the time period from when the 83(b)  election, about 30 day period that you have to make the filing, it starts from  the day that you actually buy the stock. So, that is a hard deadline, it  includes calendar days, it's not a business day period, and if you miss it, there's  really not much you can do about it.

There are some sort of things that  you can do to mitigate the tax liability if you work with tax lawyers, but  if you miss it, it can be pretty bad. So, that's one thing to definitely  remember.
Carolynn Levy: Okay.

And I will add that this is a good reason to pay really careful  attention to the date on your restricted stock purchase agreement and it should be the  same date that you write the check for the $1 ... Just pay attention to  that. You want that all happening on the same time, so you're not really worried  about like, oh my gosh, what's my actual start date.

And the other thing I'll  say about that is 83(b) election forms need to be saved by the company as  well. So the individual founder is going to save that election form for their own  tax returns in their own files, but the company needs to keep a copy too.  You put that in your shared Dropbox, you make sure it's signed, you make sure  it's date, and you save it in that safe place and the company has it  forever.

That's really important.
Jon Levy: It's one of the few things that can't be fixed.

That's also an important-
Carolynn Levy: Well, yeah.

I mean Jason was just saying like there are some ...

There are  some fixes sometimes, but they're painful and really expensive.
Jon Levy: And people look at it in diligence.

This is actually one of the few things  to remember if-
Carolynn Levy: Yeah, if you remember nothing else from this, file your 83(b) election forms. Okay. So  we also got a lot of questions that touched on a variety of immigration issues.  And here's a sample question we got.

I'm in Canada, can you help me get  a TN visa so I can work on my startup in the US. John why  don't you take a crack at that.
Jon Levy: This is a difficult ... Jeff said, we know everything, but immigration is not something  that we're experts on.

And this is a situation where you need to speak to  an expert, especially if you have situations where you're going to be ... You need  to be employed, as Carolyn was saying earlier, by your company.

And if you can't  work in the US, you can't be employed because it's illegal, then you're better off  speaking to an expert. Now, immigration is particularly tricky, it's a political issue obviously now.  So the landscape's always changing, but it's also ...

It's more of an art than  a science. So it's always been very difficult for us jumping in, knowing the basics  to talk about immigration. Were really not experts in this area, and you definitely need  to speak to an expert.
Carolynn Levy: Okay, Jason, should I be a C Corp or an S Corp?
Jason Kwon: S Corp. So, if you just file in Delaware, you're kind of C Corp by  default.

In order to actually be an S Corp, you have to make an election  on a tax form.

The difference between the two of the C Corp or S  Corp is S Corp is pass through taxation since tax transparent. So any income earned  by the corporation is then passed through to its owner, the C Corp, cuts off  the income at the level of the corporation and corporation pays taxes.

And so the  reason why you want to be a C Corp is that's the kind of entity  that investors are used to investing in.

And also, when you actually take investment from  outside investors, it will blow the S Corp election most of the time anyway.
Carolynn Levy: Okay. John, how much equity should we save for our first employees or key hires  during the incorporation of the company?
Jon Levy: It depends on the size of the company and how many people you need to  hire.

I would say the standard is probably 10 to 20 percent people think is  going to be saved for employees, but it's definitely specific to the company. So I  would ...

This is a situation where it's very easy for me to say, “Hey,  you should be very generous with your employees, and you have alignment and make sure  they are from the upside in the company.” It is something I believe very strongly  and especially if you have good employees, you want to keep them, you want them  aligned with your mission. So it's worth thinking about this in a longterm view, having  the longterm view, and setting up everyone for success.
Carolynn Levy: The online platforms, Clerky and Stripe Atlas. Well, I know Clerky for sure has ...  you can actually create a stock option pool at formation if you want to. So  if you've already thought that far ahead and you know you want to have a  plan set up, you can do that at formation.

I would say though the vast  majority of companies actually wait and don't adapt to stock option plan until they're a  little farther along. Jason, is it illegal to have unpaid interns?
Jason Kwon: Generally, yes. So you just went over this in the fundamentals. You want to avoid  unpaid employees, and interns are going to be generally considered employees.

And then there are  some exceptions you can use or take advantage of for giving people sort of college  credit if they're a college interns or things like that. But that's gonna take some  work on your part to actually learn those rules and you're probably going to need  to talk to a lawyer for those things.

And if you want to get the  help of people and so just pay them in the form of equity.

Again, that  was already covered by Carolyn's presentation, they can be contractors, but there are standards for  when somebody is classified as a contractor versus an employee, and those standards got just  recently ...

Are harder to satisfy given some of the California Supreme Court rulings.
Carolynn Levy: We had a YC Company once that have 14 interns; 14 unpaid interns, that was  a big mess. Okay. John, there's a ton of advice out there for how to  properly structure for a for profit startup, what about nonprofits? What's the best legal practices  for starting a nonprofit startup?
Jon Levy: I'm getting all the questions that I can't answer, that seems fair.

The nonprofit are  also completely different; it's a different animal.

It's different from for profits.

I mean, the  government doesn't favor nonprofits because the government likes to get taxes. Nonprofits are tax free.  So if you think about it, the government's going to make it difficult to become  a nonprofit. You have to go through all these steps and fill out forms.

It  takes like nine months.

I'm not an expert on it, YC is not an expert  on it, we do donate to nonprofits, we accept nonprofits in our program.

That said,  it's always been ... You have to have a public good ... Your company has  to be set up for the public good.

There are certain disclosures you need to  make. You have to disclose the top five salaries in the nonprofit.

And I'm certainly  not an expert in this area, so I don't want to touch on it any  more, but it's a completely different animal.
Carolynn Levy: You're out there soliciting donations from foundations rather than raising from VCs, so it is  a totally different beast. Jason, can I invite a stranger to be a partner?
Jason Kwon: So, that question is probably answered itself. Generally, you want to work with people that  you can trust and know.

And so before you bring on somebody as a partner  or co-founder, you kind of want to understand how well you're going to work together,  whether you can actually build something together, whether you can actually get along. So I  think the answer to that is not if you really want to make sure that  you're going to be successful.
Carolynn Levy: And even if the person who asked this question meant partner like advisor or some  other, not like a co-founder, but they meant something else, I would say don't ever  work with a stranger. Right? And this goes back to what I was saying about  founder breakups.

I mean, that's a recipe for disaster to work with someone you've only  just met because we've seen brothers break up; the founder breakup goes through all levels  of relationships, so you're going to stack the deck against yourself if you have a  stranger involved. John, what are key factors to consider while determining what country should one  register their parent's company in?
Jon Levy: The quick answer is where's the market, where is Your Business, who are you. Most  people set up in the US because they're attacking the US market, which is a  big market.

If you're selling something in India, you should be in India most likely.  The problem with this question like the parents subsidiary question to me, I always think  like when I'm talking to startups, keep it simple.

This lecture seems a little dry  and it's the legal mechanics, not the most exciting thing, but it's really pretty simple  if you think about.

It's like, hey, form your corporation, be serious, keep your documents,  like don't have one person squirrel it away, buy your stock from the company, never  forgets your 83(b); that's the one thing I want to drill home.

After you buy  your stock, file your 83(b), that's about it.

There's not that much to do as  long as you're serious. With parents, subsidiaries, complexity, when I hear that from companies early  on, I just want to run.
Carolynn Levy: Yeah, you're going to make it extra hard on yourself with that kind of stuff.  Jason, with the explosion of legal services tech, it's possible I may not need traditional  council until a sophisticated angel or institutional round. When do you advise your companies to  stop using these services and migrate to a traditional law firm? How would you distribute  the work between the two?
Jason Kwon: Yeah.

There are a lot of good tools out there right now. So you could  use Clerky, you can use Stripe Atlas, you can get pretty far with.

I think  when you get to the point where you're raising significant amounts of capital, you definitely  should get a lawyer because a lot of those agreements are going to be custom  and bespoke or you're just going to be some negotiation. When you're just incorporating and  setting up, those services will take care of it. You could probably go without counsel  or you could certainly get counsel if you want, especially if you want to do  something a little bit more custom. When you get to the point where you're issuing  stock to employees, you probably do want to get somebody involved just because there are  some things that can go wrong if you don't do things perfectly. You also don't  want to be careless about having written promises for stock with various people, so sometimes  outside counsel there can be very helpful in making sure you're not out over your  skis when you were talking about things like that with people.
Carolynn Levy: So John, this question is kind of similar to the one I just asked you,  so it's probably the same answer, but you can reiterate. From a legal perspective, can  I form a startup and then sell it while having a full time job? If  so, what things should I consider?
Jon Levy: I also think Jeff touched on this earlier, but this is kind of asking the  impossible.

There's no way or I've never seen any company started part-time on weekends, holidays  become like a giant company. Maybe you can do that on a small scale, but  this is a ... We're asking you to start a company out of thin air  and that is very difficult, to grow a giant ...

This is an all consuming,  full time thing.

It's not like, oh, I'm going to do this as a hobby.  So I don't want to sound dismissive, but I just think that's practically impossible.

I  wouldn't even think that way, like this isn't a part-time Gig.
Carolynn Levy: Jason, are patents ever worth applying for?
Jason Kwon: So this is sort of like a ... You could talk a very long time  about patents and whether it's useful or worthwhile applying for them.

The short answer is,  so patents are useful for protecting your technology, especially from competitions in copying your technology.  Your technology matters.

If you're pursuing a software startup or tech enabled internet company, patents  tend to matter less; there's less protection under patent law for software patents anyway.

And  most of your success is going to be determined not by their protectability of your  property under law, but rather your execution on the software.

If you're pursuing a life  sciences startup, there duplication is actually easier for competitors to execute on, so patents tend  to be more important.

And if you have questions about the specific things that you're  doing technology wise and whether it falls into the weak patent or strong patent protection  bucket, you should definitely consult with a patent expert or a lawyer on that. But  the last part of this is that no company is sort of raised money purely  on the strength of their patent portfolio, it's always gonna come down to how good  is the founding team, can they execute on their vision; the patents are just one  part of the puzzle.
Carolynn Levy: Okay. John, I'm thinking about setting up an advisory board and wonder if advisors should  have equity?
Jon Levy: In my experience, advisory board are more a non-US thing, like non Silicon Valley thing.  Maybe in Silicon Valley we see advisory boards for life sciences companies. You would see  academics and professors try to legitimize the company as advisors and get a little stock.  But this is not something where, it's not something where you give stock to people  without thought, it's more ...

I think the best quote on advisors somebody said was  like, “Advisors are investors who want stock for free.” And that's Kinda how I think  about it, like people should invest ideally instead of advising for free shares.

I know  this isn't like a one size fits all, some situations like I was saying, it's  appropriate. Maybe a life sciences company and you can have consultants who gets stocked, but  it's mostly a situation I try to avoid.
Carolynn Levy: Jason, what have you seen founders do when they had to cut off and fire  a co-founder who was a personal friend?
Jason Kwon: So has anybody here ever had a roommate who's been a friend? It's Kinda like  that, right? So sometimes it's better to not do certain things with your friend so  that you can stay friends.

And so if you have started a company with a  friend of yours and it's not working out, it's often times because you guys have  different ideas about the direction the company should go in, or if somebody is working  just a lot harder than the other person is.

It's usually better to just solve  that problem or basically resolve that problem as soon as possible rather than letting it  be something that you think or hope will work out over time and letting it  fester. Because not only does it hurt the company, it hurts the friendship too. So  it's generally better to kind of get to a quicker resolution.
Carolynn Levy: Yeah, you don't want to stall on that.
Jon Levy: No.

That's something I would add.

The biggest mistake we see is people delaying and  thinking, oh, things are going to work out and this is a friend, and things  are going to change.

It's usually best that you just end the relationship if it's  not working.
Carolynn Levy: And the startup relationship.
Jon Levy: The startup relationships, thank you.
Carolynn Levy: And hopefully preserve the friendship.
Jon Levy: Preserve the friend, exactly.
Carolynn Levy: Okay. John, what is the best methodology for reviewing potential loopholes in your privacy policies  in terms of service?
Jon Levy: This is an area where if you're going to spend money early on and a  lawyer and you have something that's tricky, that's a sensitive startup topic; it's worth spending  money on a lawyer. But there are excellent services for privacy policies and terms of  service on the internet right now [inaudible] is one, and all the major law firms  also have privacy policy generators. But if there's something specific or [inaudible] I'll send out  on the resources tab.

It's definitely important, it's required.

If you're taking somebody's information, you  have to have a privacy policy up on your website or your app in California.  So this is something you need to do, there are good services.

In certain circumstances  you're gonna need to hire a lawyer in this situation.
Carolynn Levy: So as many of you probably know, if you are collecting personally identifiable information from  anyone in the EU, you're governed by the GDPR and that's a huge quagmire.

And  so if you fall into that bucket, even though some of these privacy policy generators  are fantastic, they're not going to get ...

They're probably ...

I mean, unless someone's  really done a great one, they're probably not going to cover all the stuff you  need to know for GDPR. So you would probably want to get a lawyer for  that. Let's see, Jason, should we work 18 hours a day as a co-founder and  founder of our startup? How can we measure and manage our commitment status for our  product?
Jason Kwon: So the advice we give all of our startups is to still exercise, sleep, and  have some semblance of a life in terms of like maintaining some of your relationships  and friendships. So 18 hours a day is not something that we would recommend really,  except for maybe like short sprints where you need to get something out.

And just  remember that this is just gonna be a multiyear journey while you're building a company,  so to use a tired cliche, it's a marathon, not a sprint.
Carolynn Levy: You don't want to get sick. Okay. John, should we have a shareholder agreement and  what should be included in a good shareholder agreement?
Jon Levy: Shareholder agreements are really a non US type of document.

It's a document that describes  in detail what happens when there are departures, severance, founder breakups, or all different types  of situations.

And often they can be very detailed.

The ones that I've seen, Canadian  companies have come in with them.

It's really a foreign thing, not so much to  US.

It goes back to what we were saying or what I was saying earlier,  you want to keep things simple.

There's no reason to have this giant prenup in  a situation for a startup.

I mean, chances are if things go wrong with a  startup, there are no assets to divide anyway.

It's not like a marriage, using the  prenup analogy-
Carolynn Levy: Except when you break up.
Jon Levy: Except when you break in a marriage, there are assets hopefully.

There's a house, couch,  television, whatever; you need a prenup. Sometimes for startups, these detailed documents that I get  from the Netherlands about what happens when a company breaks up with no assets, seem  just like a waste of time to me.
Carolynn Levy: Overkill.

To clarify for some people.

I think that the person who asked this question  was talking about the shareholder agreements that John was talking about, which is among founders.  When you sell preferred stock to investors in like a series A financing, there are  shareholder agreements and they do govern a lot of the things that he just talked  about. But that's between the company and the investors. So that is different, and that  is of course a very US thing. So just to make sure people weren't confused  about that. Okay. Our last question for Jason. Many companies have information about their rounds,  like price per share or amount raised displayed on Pitchbook, Crunchbase, and other sites. Given  that this seems to be due to company charters and filings being publicly available, is  there any way to prevent outsiders from seeing this detail about your company?
Jason Kwon: The technical answer is yeah, there are methods you could use to actually conceal some  of the information to the charters.

The charter are publicly filed documents, and people can  pay $100 or whatever to pull down the charter from Delaware and look at some  of the details of your company. So that's sort of like the literal answer, but  I think the larger answer is just ...

It's not something that I would worry  about really because it's sort of way down on the list of priorities in terms  of what you need to sort of think about and plan for.

And look, there  are plenty of companies that have this information listed on Pitchbook, they're doing fine and  plenty of others that are not doing fine because it's not because they're on Pitchbook  or not on Pitchbook, it's because of other things. So it's just I wouldn't spend  a whole lot of time thinking about this.
Carolynn Levy: So Jeff and [Adora] , I don't know how we're doing on time and whether  or not you want to do any ...

Is there a Q&A?
Geoff Ralston: Are there any questions? [inaudible] why don't we take just a few questions and then  we'll call it a day.
Carolynn Levy: Okay.

Alright. Yes.
Jon Levy: I'm not an expert on nonprofits [inaudible] oh, thank you. She's asking about B Corp,  which is a quasi nonprofit and for profit corporate-
Carolynn Levy: It's a social good.
Jon Levy: ... Social enterprise where part of your mission is for the public good.

That's not  something I'm an expert in, unfortunately. Many companies have been doing it recently, it's much  more prevalent, I just I'm not really qualified to speak of it.
Carolynn Levy: It changes the fiduciary duties, right. So the whole goal of the ...

I mean,  the goal of your average corporation is you make money for the stockholders, right? B  Corp is more like there's a social good, so the fiduciary duties on the part  of the management and the directors are different.

And like John said, they're gaining in  popularity, so I think we're gonna see a lot more of them.

It's not really  YC's things, so I would hesitate to give you any advice about them. But I  know there's actually a couple of good books about them, I have one of them  [inaudible] . But there's a lot of information out there about them.
Audience: [inaudible] .
Carolynn Levy: You know, if not for YC's, maybe, but-
Jon Levy: It could be fine.
Carolynn Levy: Yeah, it could be fine.

It's just we haven't done a lot of them so  we don't really have any data about what that looks like longterm.
Geoff Ralston: One point about a B Corp is you can imagine it might not be as  attractive to your typical venture investor. So it depends on what the goals for the  company.

If you're looking to create a startup, which is high growth, fast growth, you  won't generally see a B Corp, and most investors probably look at that somewhat askance.
Carolynn Levy: Also, we do have one recently that converted into a B Corp that had been  around for like five or six years. So that's something you could think about too.
Audience: [inaudible] .
Carolynn Levy: Yeah.

I mean it can be done, I just don't know the wisdom of it.  Way back there?
Audience: [inaudible] .
Jon Levy: Yes, it is similar.

The question is, I believe you have a SaaS company in  Australia and you're attacking the US market, but you're also in Australia, you're not sure  where to incorporate again.

Again, the key is where are your customers.

It sounds like  you're thinking about the US, you not 100 percent sure, and I would just figure  out really where you want to be most from a practical standpoint.

Again, like setting  up complex structures is really what the question that we were talking about earlier, and  I have like a little aversion to that.

It could be a situation where it  makes sense to have a parent subsidiary structure for you, but it's a little more  complicated than [inaudible] .
Carolynn Levy: You can incorporate in the US and then have your Australian company be a sub,  but again, you could just incorporate in the US and just sell into Australia. Like  you could just not ...

I mean, if that's your market and that's where you  want to raise money, just incorporate and be a US company.
Jon Levy: We always suggest US companies as it's much easier to fundraise in the US and  much more favorable terms in my opinion. So I always tend to push people to  be in the US.

It's just better for the business long term.
Audience: Just two more questions.
Carolynn Levy: Okay [inaudible] got this?  I have a question about [inaudible]  Okay. So his question was when you add new co-founders later on, maybe a year  or so later, do you have to restart all the original founders vesting schedule to  match the new? And the answer is no, you do not. So you put ...  you and your original team of co-founders, let's say you put four year vesting on  your founder stock and then a year later you find a fourth co-founder who you  think is great ...

And by the way, be a little bit circumspect about throwing  the word co-founder around. Like sometimes that person who comes a year later is just  a key hire and not a founder.

There's a lot of emotional attachment to the  word founder in Silicon Valley, we all know why. But not everyone's a co-founder. But  to answer your question, no, you guys will stay on the same vesting schedule.

The  new person who came a year later, we'll start four years on the day that  he or she started at your company. Now, the thing that some of you probably  already know is that when your investors come in, they may decide they want to  restart you all.

I mean, unless you had absolutely zero leverage, so not going to  start you back on square one. But sometimes investors look at your schedule and they  say, “Ah, you guys only have about a year left? That's not really enough for  us. Can we put on another year.” So that happens every now and then, and  again, it depends a lot on leverage, but don't be surprised if that happens. Did  that answer your question? Okay.
Audience: One more. One last question. So you talk about having [inaudible] applied outside US, and  part of [inaudible]
Jon Levy: So the question was how do you hire outside of the US when you have  a US entity?
Audience: [inaudible]
Jon Levy: Yeah. So, the short but unsatisfying answer is going to be that it depends on  which country because each country has different sort of rules for who counts as an  employee and who counts as a contractor and what you have to do in order  to actually satisfy those roles.

And then also, when you actually open up a significant  presence in any sort of foreign country, what you often times have to do is  create a local entity and sometimes that can be a subsidiary and sometimes it can  actually be something more simple like a local branch.

Again, your menu of options sort  of depends on which country you're going into.

I don't know, do you have like  a country specifically? Yeah, India. So India, typically what happens is there's a subsidiary that's  created, it's usually owned 99 percent by the American parent, Delaware parent and one percent,  or some other small percentage by one or two local Indian sort of representatives.

And  then that subsidiary is the one that hires employees in India.
Audience: [inaudible]
Jon Levy: I think if you want to try and avoid that kind of structure ...

Again,  I'm not an expert on India law, you probably need to talk to somebody who  actually has a license in India to actually advise on the employment issue because just  like in the United States, various countries have stronger or weaker protections for when you  can classify somebody as an employee or not.
Audience: Okay.
Geoff Ralston: Thank you guys very much. So sorry to have to cut off, I know there's  a lot more questions live here. Remember Darby Wong from Clerky is having an AMA  now, tomorrow, but it's open now, you can post questions. So if you have questions,  that is an outlet, and you can always work with your group to ask more  questions. Just one more word on the part-time question, which has come up a few  times and we discussed a little bit at the break.

The way I look at  that, it is certainly true that some companies are kicked off while people are working  in a full-time job. But those aren't really companies yet, they're just projects, they're just  ideas. Once you really start your company, and all of the great companies have this  feature, you'll be on a full time; you'll be on a more than full-time, you'll  be on at 120 percent. So, thank you all for coming in person and thank  you for watching online. Just a couple reminders.

There will be a conversation with the  founder of Y Combinator, Paul Graham on Friday, as well as the AMA tomorrow with  Darby. Next week we're going to dive into product with the CEO of YC, Michael  Seibel, and David Rusenko from Weebly on building product and product market fit.

There are  also several great videos in the startup library on product that I very much encourage  you guys to take a look at.

And lastly, log in to the site, many  of you already have. Post on the forum, post in your group, and figure out  how it works. Hopefully, it'll be good home for all of you, and if you  have any issues, send an email to ycombinator@startupschool.org, and everyone have a great day.

Thanks.
